# What is it?
* It's an injected DLL trainer for the game ['Dishonored'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/Dishonored/).
* Gives cheats which aren't available in-game.
* Windows only, due to the game not supporting MAC/Linux.

# Features
* God Mode
* Infinite Ammo, Mana, and Gold.
* More to come.

# How to use
* Build with Visual Studio
* Run the injector with the DLL in the same directory, with the game already running.
* No 3rd party dependencies.

* If there's a feature you want, or a bug you want to fix, then submit a pull request or open an issue.
